   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Kodistubs documentation!
===================================
(former xbmcstubs)
------------------

These files can help you to develop a script or an addon for `Kodi (XBMC)`_ Media Center.
Use them in your favorite IDE to enable autocompletion of function, class and method names and access docstrings
for each function, class and method.

.. warning:: Kodistubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code,
   so don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into Kodistubs
   or use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.
