Welcome to Kodistubs documentation!
===================================
(former xbmcstubs)
------------------

Kodi stubs are Python files can help you to develop addons for `Kodi (XBMC)`_ Media Center.
Use them in your favorite :abbr:`IDE (Integrated Developement Environment)`
to enable autocompletion and view docstrings for Kodi Python API functions, classes and mehtods.

.. warning:: Kodistubs are literally stubs and do not include any useful code,
    so don't try to run your program outside Kodi unless you add some testing code into Kodistubs
    or use some mocking library to mock Kodi Pyhton API.
